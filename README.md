# LPro AIT 2019 - TP1

All **procedures** will be written as a *.md* file in a folder `/procedures/assembly`, or `/procedures/test`.

All **reports** will be written as a *.md* file in a folder `/reports/...`.

**Don't forget to `commit` and `push` every time you completed a task.**

## 1. Hardware

1. [Arduino Uno](https://store.arduino.cc/)
2. Motor: [EMG30](https://www.gotronic.fr/art-motoreducteur-encodeur-emg30-866.htm)
3. Motor driver: [Pololu DRV8835 Dual Motor Driver Shield for Arduino](https://www.pololu.com/product/2511)
    - [How to install the library](https://github.com/pololu/drv8835-motor-shield)
4. Digital compass HMC5883L from [Octopus 9DOF module](https://www.elecfreaks.com/estore/octopus-9dof-module.html)

## 2. Motor assembly

1. Write a detailed assembly procedure to mount the motor to the blue support.
    - Pictures might help
    - An anomaly report about the too-small-holes in the blue support might be necessary

2. Write a detailed assembly procedure to mount the motor driver on the Arduino and connect the motor.
    - Connect only *+ Motor* and *- Motor*. The speed sensor won't be used.

3. Use the provided code to control the motor and propose and write a test procedure of the assembly.

**Don't forget to `commit` and `push` every time you completed a task.**

## 3. Octopus 9DOF module assembly - Compass only (HMC5883L)

1. Same exercice as previously. Complete previous assembly and test procedures.
    - Use power supply on the motor driver blue connectors.
    - <span style="color:red">**Double check you plugged power supply properly. I don't have spare modules!! If the red LED does not turn on, unplug the USB cable.**</span>
    - The compass might not have its 0 value aligned with the magnetic North. We won't mind about this during this TP. (In real life an offset has to be foud and applied... ask Augustin and Fran√ßois if you want to know more.)

## 4. System control

1. Develop a programm aligning the Y-axis of the digital compass to the measured North (with a proper P/PD/PI/PID controler).
2. Propose a test procedure of the assembled system.

## 5. Finished?

There's more! Ask.
